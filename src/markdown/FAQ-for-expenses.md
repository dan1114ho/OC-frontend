### <a name="expense">How do I submit an expense and get paid?
Go to the page of the Collective you're submitting the expense to, and click "Submit Expense". You will need to upload a valid receipt or invoice, and provide your PayPal address.

Each collective and host can specify expense policies and helpful info, like the details for invoicing, at the top of the 'new expense' page ([example](https://opencollective.com/webpack/expenses/new)).

You can submit two kinds of expenses:
- A **receipt** to be reimbursed for something you paid for (stickers, online services, meals, plane tickets, etc).
- An **invoice** for your time/work.

[Here is an invoice template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ROQA11PaYjGtcie-1Ut8cFV5LCISKipSu8sgsY5U7vw/edit?usp=sharing) you can use. Fill out the blue parts, and change the invoicee to the correct host organization if needed.

In order to be paid, submitted expenses must be approved by the Collective's core contributors, who ensure valid use of the Collective's funds.

To approve expenses for your Collective, use the links on the notification email you receive, or log in to your Collective and click on the expense.

Expenses are paid weekly, on Fridays. Please contact [our support](mailto:support@opencollective.com) if you have any questions.


### What's the decision process to approve and pay an expense?

Anyone can file an expense to any collective (in the same way that anyone can make a pull request to any open source project). But one of the administrators of the collective has to approve it.

Once approved, the host of the collective (the legal entity or person that collects the money on behalf of the collective) can then proceed to pay it.

The collective and the host may have custom expense policies. You will find them just above the form to submit an invoice. Please read them carefully. They provide information about what types of expenses can or cannot be approved.

Even though the expense might be approved by the collective, the host may still ask for more information (e.g. if the receipt or invoice does not contain all the information necessary for their accounting).

Notes: 
- Whenever you modify the amount or description of the expense, it will have to be approved again by one of the administrators of the collective. Once the expense has been paid, it cannot be modified.

### Is the receipt or invoice public?

All expenses are public but their attachment is kept private as it may contain personal information. Only the administrators of the collective and of the host can see it.

### What makes an expense valid?

To be valid, an invoice must include: 
 - What it is for (feature built, work done, etc)
 - Amount to be paid
 - Your full name
 - Your physical address
 - The name of the Collective
 - The name of the host organization (for example, most open source software projects are in the "Open Source Collective" host)

Private information provided on invoices is not viewable publicly. The expense amount will be listed on the Collective's public page, but the invoice itself is only visible to the host and core contributors.

### Tax forms

If you are filling invoices for more than $600 (or equivalent) in the year, you will need to send one of those forms to the host of your collective:

- US nationals/residents fill out [this form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf).
- Non-US nationals/residents use [this form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf).

Note: Reimbursed expenses don't count in the $600 limit. This is only if you are getting paid by the collective.
