### Where goes the money raised by the collectives that I host?

Straight to the bank account attached to your Stripe Account.

### How to get the money out?

To get the money out, people submit expenses or invoices on their open collective page (see the "submit expense" button). While you can approve those expenses as the host, it is recommended that you let one of the admins of the collective do it.

Once approved, you can pay out those expenses either manually and record them as paid, or with one click using the PayPal integration (if the submitter of the expense has provided a PayPal email). You can manage all this at the host level on https://opencollective.com/:host/dashboard (replace `:host` with the URL of your host).

### What payment methods do you support to pay out expenses?

Right now, we only support PayPal and "manual" as payout methods. Manual means that you can manually record any money that you received outside of the Open Collective platform (e.g. bank transfer, crypto currency, cash, etc.).

### How to pay out expenses with PayPal?

From your host dashboard (`https://opencollective.com/:host/dashboard`), you can connect your PayPal account  and authorize it to spend for up to $2,000 USD (or equivalent).
Note: make sure that you are connecting a PayPal account that is connected to the same bank account than your Stripe Account.

Then with just one click you can pay out an expense that has been approved. When you run out of your PayPal pre-authorized allowance, you can simply reconnect your PayPal account and you are good to spend another $2,000 USD equivalent.

### What if a collective wants to receive money via bank transfer instead of credit card? (or any other unsupported payment method)

You can allow your collectives to receive donations via bank transfer (or any other payment method that you want). Just share with the instructions they need to share with their donors. Then you can manually record those donations from your host dashboard. Just select the collective in the dropdown menu and click on "Add Funds". You will need to specify the source of the money (e.g. the name of the individual or organization that made the bank transfer) and the host fee that you want to keep for processing such payment (the default is your usual host fee). The balance of the collective will be credited accordingly.
Note that there is no Open Collective platform fee in this case.
