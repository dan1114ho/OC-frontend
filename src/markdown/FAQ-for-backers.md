### How do I make a donation?

You rock! We are delighted you are asking this question. Go to the Collective’s page (e.g. https://opencollective.com/wwcodeatl), choose one of the predefined tiers suggested by the collective or make a custom donation. Fill out the form (be sure to choose whether you'd like to make the donation as yourself an individual or as an organization), et voilà! Now you are part of that collective, your community will appreciate it.

If your donation is in the form of an expense you paid, which you don't want to be reimbursed for (as your contribution), please submit the receipt as an expense to the Collective, and choose the "donation" payment method option.

### Can I have a monthly reporting of the collectives that I'm supporting

Yes, you will receive automatically on the first of the month an email report with all the collectives that you are supporting. This reports includes your contribution, their current balance, how much they spent last month and on what and links to their latest updates and events.

### Can I have an invoice?

It depends on the host of the collective. If the host is a legal entity, you will automatically receive a PDF invoice with all the proper information (see for the link to download it in the email receipt after you make a donation). You can also download them on the list of transactions on your profile page (when you are logged in).

### Are donations tax deductible?

It depends on the host of the collective. If you are based in the US and the host is a non profit that has the 501c3 status, then you will automatically receive a donation receipt that is tax deductible.

Some of the 501c3 hosts on Open Collective include the [Open Collective Foundation[(https://opencollective.com/foundation), [Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode).

### Why do you have monthly payments from backers/sponsors as the default?

A collective is an organization of people working together towards a common goal. Sometimes these goals take a few months or a few years to achieve. By supporting a collective with a recurring monthly amount, you help the collective plan out its future.
          
### <a name="charge-date-notice"></a>Why do you charge recurring monthly subscriptions on 1st of every month?
It helps our collectives manage their monthly budget. Instead of getting donations randomly throughout the month, they can start with a minimum budget for that month. Any new donations improve the budget.

We're working on a way to charge a single payment spread out across monthly contributions, to reduce payment processor transaction fees.
          
### How can I cancel my monthly donation?
We are sorry to see you go! Go to your subscriptions page (https://opencollective.com/:profile/subscriptions) (replace `:profile` with the url of your profile).
