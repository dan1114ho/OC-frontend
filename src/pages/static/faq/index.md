### What is Open Collective?

It's an online platform for open and transparent communities. We provide the tools to raise money and share your finance in full transparency.

### How much does it cost?

Like most other crowdfunding platforms, Open Collective takes a 5% commission which doesn't include the payment processor fees (Stripe, PayPal).

If you decide to have your collective hosted by someone else, the host may charge an addition commission for managing bookkeeping, taxes, and admin (fiscal sponsorship). For example, the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) charges 5% to host open source projects around the world and facilitate invoicing with big tech companies like [Facebook](https://opencollective.com/fbopensource), [AirBnB](https://opencollective.com/airbnb), [Coinbase](https://opencollective.com/coinbase), etc.
[Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode) is charging 10% to enable groups of women around the world to create a local Women Who Code Chapter to teach each other how to code. They also provide other services like [a job board](https://www.womenwhocode.com/jobs), [events](https://www.womenwhocode.com/events), etc.
