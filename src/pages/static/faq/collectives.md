# FAQ for collectives

### What is an Open Collective?

An Open Collective is a group of people with a shared mission that operates in full transparency. Everyone can see how they receive or spend money.

### What can I do with Open Collective?

- Set up a page to collect membership fees and donations ([example](https://opencollective.com/RailsGirlsAtl))
- Let your members submit expenses and reimburse them with a click ([example](https://opencollective.com/RailsGirlsAtl/expenses/new))
- Give everyone visibility on your budget ([example](https://opencollective.com/RailsGirlsAtl/expenses))

If you have an organization, you can use Open Collective to empower local chapters to raise money in their community and have their own budget ([example](https://opencollective.com/wwcode)). See [becoming an Open Collective Host](becoming-an-open-collective-host).

### What is Open Collective good for?

Open Collective is perfect for any community or any side project that is not for profit. Communities and side projects should be fun. You shouldn't have to worry about creating and maintaining a legal entity and doing bookkeeping just to collect money to reimburse your expenses. Open Collective is ideal for all kinds of groups, like meetups, open source projects, parent associations, neighborhood associations, clubs, unions, movements, non-profits, and business incubators.

### Why should I use Open Collective?

Open Collective makes it easy to be transparent about your finances. We help you collect recurring contributions from supporters, whether you're funding an ongoing work on open source software, collecting dues for a parent association, or charging a monthly fee for your food coop. Once you have the money on Open Collective, reimbursing expenses is simple, and everyone can see how funds are being spent. We believe that financial transparency creates stronger collaboration.

### What do Collectives spend money on? How do they decide what to pay for?

There are as many answers to this question as there are collectives! It's up to each community to decide how to spend their funds. The administrators of the Open Collective can approve expenses for payment from your funds (which anyone can submit), and you can have as many administrators as you need. Some communities delegate financial decision-making to a specific person or role, some develop policies about what should be funded, and others have processes in place to make spending decisions together as a group.

If you'd like some ideas and examples of what collectives fund, check out this article from [our blog](https://medium.com/open-collective): [Has Your Open Source Community Raised Money? Hereâ€™s How to Spend It](https://medium.com/open-collective/has-your-open-source-community-raised-money-heres-how-to-spend-it-3e9dd957dad).
Some common examples are hosting costs, documentation, community moderation, t-shirts and stickers, conference travel expenses, food at meetups, work on specific features... even paying someone to work on the project full time! It completely depends on the needs and culture of your project.

### How is it different from other crowdfunding platforms?

Two major differences:

- While most crowdfunding is about one-off projects, Open Collective helps you raise money recurringly (e.g. monthly) to finance the ongoing activities of your community. That way, you can plan your activities against an anticipated monthly budget.
- Open Collective operates with full financial transparency and accountability. Other platforms hand over the money without showing the backers, who provided the funds, how it's used. On Open Collective, you submit expenses for everyone to see. We believe transparency leads to healthier organizations and communities.

### How does it work?

When you create a collective, the money collected goes to the bank account associated with the collective. When someone wants to use the money, they submit an expense on the public page of your collective (like this one). After the expense is approved by you, the person is automatically reimbursed to their PayPal account. The budget and all the expenses are visible publicly.

### How much does it cost?

Like most other crowdfunding platforms, Open Collective takes a 5% commission which doesn't include the payment processor fees (Stripe, PayPal).

If you decide to have your collective hosted by someone else, the host may charge an addition commission for managing bookkeeping, taxes, and admin (fiscal sponsorship). For example, the [Open Source Collective](https://opencollective.com/opensource) charges 5% to host open source projects around the world and facilitate invoicing with big tech companies like [Facebook](https://opencollective.com/fbopensource), [AirBnB](https://opencollective.com/airbnb), [Coinbase](https://opencollective.com/coinbase), etc.
[Women Who Code](https://opencollective.com/wwcode) is charging 10% to enable groups of women around the world to create a local Women Who Code Chapter to teach each other how to code. They also provide other services like [a job board](https://www.womenwhocode.com/jobs), [events](https://www.womenwhocode.com/events), etc.

### What is a host? Do I need one?

The host of an Open Collective is the legal person or entity that receives the money on behalf of the collective. It is therefore responsible for doing the bookkeeping and respect the financial regulations in their country.

If your collective is small, and depending on the regulations in your country, hosting yourself your collective has an individual might be good enough.

But if you need to start providing donation receipts or invoices to your backers, you will have to create a legal entity. Because it's such a burden and a distraction from your day to day activities, Open Collective makes it easy to share a host. That way, the burden of accounting and compliance can be mutualized across a lot of collectives that operate in the same space (either by type of activity, like open source projects, or by geography, like all citizen initiatives in Brussels).
